    "text": "1 Introduction\nMigration and refugee statistics offer a unique lens into the intricate dynamics of our ever-changing global landscape. In a world shaped by geopolitical shifts, climate change, economic disparity, and conflict, understanding these statistics is critical not only for policymakers but also for global citizens seeking to grasp the challenges and opportunities of international migration.\nThis project delves into comprehensive migration data to uncover meaningful insights and address pressing questions. How has the global movement of people evolved over the years? Which regions are most impacted by refugee movements, and what underlying factors drive these trends? Are there disparities in migration and refugee patterns based on gender or geographic regions? These are just a few of the questions we aim to answer through this study.\nMigration and displacement are not just numbers—they represent individuals, families, and communities seeking safety, opportunity, or a better future. By analyzing this data, we hope to shed light on global patterns, identify regions of high migration pressure, and provide data-driven evidence to inform humanitarian responses and policy interventions.\nThis topic is more than just a statistical analysis; it is a story of resilience, hope, and humanity. By addressing data gaps, visualizing trends, and contextualizing the numbers, we aim to empower readers to better understand the profound implications of migration and refugee movements in shaping the future of our interconnected world.",

Replacing missing values with zero for numerical analysis while preserving a log of missing patterns. 2. Standardizing numeric fields by removing commas. 3. Reshaping the data to ensure categories (e.g., “Refugees,” “Asylum Seekers”) are in separate columns.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing Value Analysis\n\n2.2.1 Process of Analysis\nTo analyze missing values in our dataset, we followed these steps: 1. Identified the variables with missing data using summary statistics and visualizations. 2. Visualized the patterns of missing data across variables and years to detect trends or anomalies. 3. Analyzed the impact of missing data on key variables such as value, which includes refugee counts and other demographic information. 4. Proposed strategies for handling missing data, such as imputation or exclusion, depending on the observed patterns.\n\n\n2.2.2 Patterns Observed\nOur analysis revealed the following patterns in missing data: - The variable value exhibited a significant proportion of missing data, particularly in certain categories such as Asylum Seekers. - Missing data varied by year, with older records (e.g., 2005) having more missing values compared to recent records (e.g., 2020). - Regional data was more complete for high-income countries but less so for low-income and conflict-affected regions.\n\n\n2.2.3 Visualizations\n\n\n2.2.4 Percentage of Missing Values per Column\nThis analysis identifies the proportion of missing values for each column in the dataset to understand which variables have significant data gaps.\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Ensure data is loaded properly\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"path_to_your_cleaned_csv_file.csv\")\n\n# Calculate the percentage of missing values per column\nmissing_values &lt;- data |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) \n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"Column\", values_to = \"Missing\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = (Missing / nrow(data)) * 100)\n\n# Bar plot of missing values\nggplot(missing_values, aes(x = reorder(Column, -Percentage), y = Percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of Missing Values per Column\", \n       x = \"Columns\", \n       y = \"Percentage of Missing Values\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Create missing value matrix\nmissing_matrix &lt;- is.na(data) \n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  mutate(row_id = 1:n()) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(-row_id, names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"Missing\")\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(missing_matrix, aes(x = Variable, y = row_id)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = Missing)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"steelblue\", \"red\"), \n                   labels = c(\"Present\", \"Missing\"),\n                   name = \"Value Status\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x = \"Variables\", \n       y = \"Observation Number\",\n       title = \"Missing Value Pattern Matrix\")\n\n\n2.2.5 Commentary: Graph 2 - population vise missing value.\nThe bar chart shows the proportion of missing values in each column. The Other of concern to UNHCR (number) column has the highest missing percentage (~45%), followed by Asylum seekers, including pending cases (number) and Total refugees and people in refugee-like situations (number). Core variables such as Year and Region/Country/Area exhibit no missing values, ensuring consistent contextual data. The variability in missing values suggests potential issues in data collection across regions and categories, necessitating targeted imputation or exclusion strategies.\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Commentary: Graph 2 - Matrix Represention for missing value pattern\nThe matrix visualization reveals that missing values (red) occur systematically in some columns, notably Other of concern to UNHCR (number) and Asylum seekers, including pending cases (number). Variables such as Region/Country/Area and Year remain complete (blue), providing reliable context for analysis. The clustering of missing values across observations indicates potential issues with data collection in specific time periods or regions.\n\n\n2.2.7 Conclusion\nThe analysis of missing data indicates that it is unevenly distributed across variables, years, and regions. To ensure the reliability of our insights: - Missing values in critical variables (e.g., value) will be imputed using appropriate methods (e.g., mean/mode imputation). - For variables or years with excessive missing data, we may exclude them from analysis to avoid introducing bias.",
