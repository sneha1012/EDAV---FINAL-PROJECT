    "text": "1 Introduction\nMigration and refugee statistics offer a unique lens into the intricate dynamics of our ever-changing global landscape. In a world shaped by geopolitical shifts, climate change, economic disparity, and conflict, understanding these statistics is critical not only for policymakers but also for global citizens seeking to grasp the challenges and opportunities of international migration.\nThis project delves into comprehensive migration data to uncover meaningful insights and address pressing questions. How has the global movement of people evolved over the years? Which regions are most impacted by refugee movements, and what underlying factors drive these trends? Are there disparities in migration and refugee patterns based on gender or geographic regions? These are just a few of the questions we aim to answer through this study.\nMigration and displacement are not just numbers—they represent individuals, families, and communities seeking safety, opportunity, or a better future. By analyzing this data, we hope to shed light on global patterns, identify regions of high migration pressure, and provide data-driven evidence to inform humanitarian responses and policy interventions.\nThis topic is more than just a statistical analysis; it is a story of resilience, hope, and humanity. By addressing data gaps, visualizing trends, and contextualizing the numbers, we aim to empower readers to better understand the profound implications of migration and refugee movements in shaping the future of our interconnected world.",

Replacing missing values with zero for numerical analysis while preserving a log of missing patterns. 2. Standardizing numeric fields by removing commas. 3. Reshaping the data to ensure categories (e.g., “Refugees,” “Asylum Seekers”) are in separate columns.",
