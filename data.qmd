# Data

## Description

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [UN Data](https://data.un.org), specifically focusing on migration and refugee statistics. This dataset provides a detailed view of global migration trends, including the number of international migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and other populations of concern, categorized by region and year.

### Key Details:

- **Source**: [UN Data - Migration and Refugee Statistics](https://data.un.org)
- **Data Format**: Comma-separated values (CSV).
- **Size and Dimensions**:
  - **Rows**: 7,239
  - **Columns**: 7 (`region_country_area`, `year`, `series`, `value`, etc.)
- **Variables**:
  - `region_country_area`: The geographic region or country being analyzed.
  - `year`: Year of data collection (e.g., 2005, 2010, 2015).
  - `series`: The category of data (e.g., "Total Refugees," "Asylum Seekers").
  - `value`: Numeric value for the given metric and year.
  - `footnotes` and `source`: Additional information about the data.

### Challenges:

- **Missing Values**: A significant proportion of rows have missing values in key columns, such as `value`.
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Numeric fields include commas, requiring cleaning and conversion.
- **Multiple Categories per Region/Year**: The `series` column creates a challenge for reshaping the dataset for analysis.

The cleaned version of this dataset, prepared using R, addresses these issues by:
1. Replacing missing values with zero for numerical analysis while preserving a log of missing patterns.
2. Standardizing numeric fields by removing commas.
3. Reshaping the data to ensure categories (e.g., "Refugees," "Asylum Seekers") are in separate columns.
